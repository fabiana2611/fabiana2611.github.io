<p style="text-align: justify;">An important point to pay attention is the code style. It looks like a silly thing but it's not. The code style help to make a readable code. And it makes the work less tiring.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about this, but I'd like to give to you three good references that I believe can be used to consulting when we are coding. If all the team uses the same reference to formatting the coding then to read and maintenance code is easier.</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf">Java Code Conventions</a></li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The references talk about braces, imports, formatting, comments, etc. Sometimes they can be a little different from each other. There are no right or wrong. The important thing is to have a convention with the team.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Practice this with your team. If you don't want to use any one of them then you can do a pattern for your company and show everyone. For sure it will be a great benefit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">That's it for now. Go deeply and have fun coding!!!.</p>
