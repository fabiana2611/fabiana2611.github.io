Hey guys?!?! 

Do you need to develop a large system where you can have all the control and security of the application, but worrying about business logic, with low cost and high speed ????

Java EE can be your solution.

Java EE, initially called J2EE (from 1.4 to 1.5), is a standard Java language platform where you can develop distributed software with the ease of providing libraries and supporting scalability, security, and so on. It is developed using the [Java Community Process](https://www.jcp.org/en/home/index) with [contribution](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html) of the industry, open source communities and Java users.

This support is able by specifications ([JSR](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/java-ee-8-3890673.html)) created and implemented by [APIs](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_de_programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_aplica%C3%A7%C3%B5es). There are many Implementations, that is, there can be more than one implementation for a specification. The development team choose the one that best fits their project.

Examples of specifications are: Servlets, JSF, EJB, JPA.

<h3>Multitiered</h3>

Java EE is composed of components that are self-contained functional software. In addition, Java EE offers a [multitiered](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview004.html#BNAAY) model, component reuse possibility, data exchange, and flexible transaction control.

The client layer stays on the client machine and is where the client applications and applets will be. They run on the client.

In the Web layer there are Servlets and JSP or JSF pages, which are examples of web components that run on the server.

At the business layer there are the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) components that run on the server.

Server and client layers can also include components based on the JavaBeans component architecture to manage the flow of data between components or database. [JavaBens](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans) components are not considered Java EE components.

The database layer, Enterprise Information System (EIS), controls the system information.

<h3>Container</h3>

ava EE provides services that make developer able to be focused on the business logic of the application. These services are available in [containers](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview005.html). Containers provide infrastructure services for component execution, which can support security services, transaction management, servlet lifecycle, [JNDI](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jndi-136720.html) lookups, and remote connection.

Before the components are executed, they are deployed in the container.

Container Type

<ul class="ul1">
	<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">EJB container: Manages the execution of enterprise beans for Java EE applications.</p>
</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Web container: Manages the execution of web pages, servlets, and some EJB components for Java EE applications.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Application client container: Manages the execution of application client components.</li>
	<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Applet container: Manages the execution of applets.</p>
</li>
</ul>

An example of the container is [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/),  a container for Web applications. An example of complete containers, serving for the complete application (web and business) we have [WildFly](http://www.wildfly.org/), [WebLogic](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/weblogic/overview/index.html), [GlassFish](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/middleware/glassfish/overview/index.html).

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<ul>
	<li class="li1"><span class="s2">EAR: deployment descriptor, the enterprise bean files, and related files (JAR + WAR).
</span></li>
	<li class="li1"><span class="s2">JAR: deployment descriptor, the class files for the application client, and related files.
</span></li>
	<li class="li1"><span class="s2">WAR: deployment descriptor, the Web component files, and related resources.
</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Deploy</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deployment is typically a three-stage process: </span></p>

<ol class="ol1">
	<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Installation: the application is moved to the server, the additional container-specific classes and interfaces are generated, and application components are installed into the appropriate Java EE containers </span></li>
	<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Configuration: external dependencies declared by the Application Component Provider are resolved and application assembly instructions defined by the Application Assembler are followed. </span></li>
	<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Execution: start the application.</span></li>
</ol>
