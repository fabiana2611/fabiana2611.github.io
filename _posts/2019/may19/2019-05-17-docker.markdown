<p style="text-align: justify;">Today I will talk about <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. It is a nice whale that has been appearing in the development environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Yeah. Reading something about that I was very enthusiastic with that. Who usually studies new IT topics to perform some tests knows how annoying sometimes have to go installing and configuring various tools, polluting your computer with various technologies to perform some tests and then have to discard. With docker this can be solved. With docker you can centralize these settings and, when you finish your tests, you can throw away or even save a portion of the environment that you can use at other times.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, Docker is muuuuuch more than that. Docker helps you through the entire development process, from the development itself to the production environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Good, but my goal here is to just give you a general idea about what docker is and what it can bring of benefits. And from there each one will be able to deepen according to two needs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s go!!!.</p>

<h3>What is it – An Overview</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/">Docker</a> is an open source project that aims to leave applications in containers. Docker can be used to develop, deploy, and run applications. It allows you to separate the application from the infrastructure.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone who works developing application knows how annoying it is often to worry about the environment itself instead of focusing on the main focus that is developing features.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The docker is based on client-server architecture where the client initiates a request to the server (deamon), the server can be remote or not. This communication is performed via <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST API</a>, CLI (terminal) and the Kitematic (GUI).

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some confusion is common when start tje studies on Docker. One of that is the fact that Docker is not virtual machine (VM).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A good comparison was made in the <em>eBook: Docker-for-Virtualization-Admin</em> that compares VM to a house and the Docker is compared to an apartment. In a house, the whole structure is individual and independent, while in an apartment a part of the structure is shared. You can create Docker image only with what will be used in your application. While the VMs start with the complete operating system and depending on the application, the developer may or may not perform some customization. But that does not mean that VM and Docker container cannot coexist. It is possible to have a Docker container inside a VM.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In a simplistic way, we can consider that docker is something to manage an easy, small portion of the infrastructure needed to run an application. It is possible to have more than one such structure in communication, but this detail I leave for who will need to go deep according to their needs.</p>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#images">Image</a>: read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#what-is-a-dockerfile">Dockerfiles</a>: scripts that automate the process of constructing images; they define what will exist inside the containers. It is a simple text file with a list of commands that will indicate to the client docker what should be created in the image.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#cmd">CMD</a>: instruction in Dockerfile that set the command to be executed when running a container from an image</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#entrypoint">ENTRYPOINT</a>: instruction that allow to configure a container that will run as an executable</li>
  <li><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/docker-entrypoint-vs-cmd">CMD vs ENTRYPOINT</a>: both are instructions to run when the container start, but ENTRYPOINT sets the process to run, while CMD supplies default arguments to that process</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#containers">Containers</a>: runnable instance of an image</li>
  <li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>: Register of images. You can see how to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/quickstart/">here</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/">Volumes</a>: mechanism for persisting data managed by Docker. The contents are outside of the container's scope.</li>
  <li>Daemon: a portion of the server where there is container management</li>
  <li>CLI: commands and communicates with the docker daemon</li>
  <li>Docker Machine: Creates a host on your computer, in the cloud, or in your data center</li>
  <li>Docker compose: a tool for defining and executing multi-container applications</li>
  <li>Docker Swarm: native clustering solution for docker;</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each built container can be stored and made available in a repository, which works similarly to GitHub.</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Have small images</li>
 <li>Use swarm whenever possible</li>
 <li>Use continuous integration for application testing and deployment</li>
 <li>Create ephemeral containers, that is, containers that can be simply replaced.</li>
 <li>Do not install unnecessary things</li>
 <li>Each container must have a goal</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some commands</h3>

{% highlight ruby %}

$ docker build -t MY_IMG .

$ docker run MY_IMG

$ docker inspect MY_IMG

$ docker login 

$ docker push MY_HUB_PATH

$ docker volume create MY_VOL

$ docker volume ls

$ docker volume inspect MY_VOLUME

$ docker container stop MY_CONTAINER

$ docker container rm MY_CONTAINER

$ docker volume rm MY_VOLUME

{% endhighlight %}
