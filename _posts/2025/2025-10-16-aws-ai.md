<ul>
	<li>Large, general-purpose pre-trained models</li>
	<li>They can be adapted for various tasks</li>
	<li>ChatGPT: trained model</li>
	<li>A multimodal model can accept a mix of input types such as audio/text and create a mix of output types such as video/image</li>

	<li>It is a subset of foundation models that can understand and generate human language</li>
	<li>Focused on language-based tasks (summarization, text generation, classification, open-ended conversation, and information extraction)</li>
	<li>They are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data</li>
	<li>It uses DL to analyze and predict word sequences</li>
	<li>Examples: OpenAI's generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models</li>
	<li>Services for LLM: AWS Bedrock and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/">Amazon SageMaker JumpStart</a></li>
</ul>

Data: 
<ul>
 	<li>Training Data: Inputs variables (e.g image) and Target Variables (e.g label that identify the image)</li>
 	<li>Type of data: Structured data (Tabular) and Unstructured data (text, images, audio)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>Underfitting</b> occurs when a model cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training data and new data. When underfit models experience high bias they give inaccurate results.</li>
	<li><b>Overfitting</b> happens when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, leading to excellent performance on the training data but poor generalization to new, unseen data. When overfit models experience high variance they give accurate results. Prevention: cross-validation (dividing the data into multiple training and validation sets), regularization (L1 and L2 - penalization), and pruning to simplify the model and improve its generalization</li>
	<li>It's necessary a balance</li>
</ul>

	<li>Accuracy is a broad metric typically used to evaluate classification tasks where the model's <u>output is compared against the correct label</u>. </li>
	<li>ROUGE (Recall-oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): measures the <u>overlap between generated and reference texts</u>. It is testing for recall ability</li>
	<li>BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): primarily used for <u>machine translation</u>. How closely a generated translations matches a reference by comparing word sequence.</li>
	<li>BERTScore: evaluates the <u>quality of the text</u> generator by leveraging embbeding. It used pre-trained Burt models or bi-directional encoder representations from transformers.</li>
</ul>

How well Foundation models meet business objectives:
<ul>
	<li>productivity: high output quality with minimum human intervention</li>
	<li>user engagement: how often and deeply users interact with the model </li>
	<li>task engineering: how effective the model can complete specific tasks</li>
</ul>
