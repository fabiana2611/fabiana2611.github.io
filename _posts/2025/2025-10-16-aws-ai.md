<h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3> 

<ul>
	<li><em>Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy.</em> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence">[1]</a></li>
	<li>Techniques:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/computer-vision/">Computer Vision:</a> based on the computer video analysis of images in real time. Whereas computer vision involves <u>interpreting and understanding</u> the content of images to make decisions, image processing focuses on enhancing and manipulating images for visual quality. CNNs are used for single image analysis and RNNs are used for video analysis. ResNet is a deep neural network architecture used mainly in computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning">Deep Learning:</a> uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. CNNs are a type of deep learning model</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing (NLP):</a> uses machine learning to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>



<h3>Machine Learning (ML)</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/">Machine Learning</a> creates models from training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data.</li>
	<li>The performance is improved when they are exposed to more data</li>
	<li>Machine Learning models can be deterministic (e.g Decision Trees) or probabilistic (e.g Bayesian Networks) or a mix of both (e.g neural networks and random forests) </li>
	<li>Use cases: spam detection, recommendation systems, predictive analytics</li>
</ul>


<h3>Deep Learning (DL)</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Subset of ML</li>
	<li>It utilizes artificial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">neural networks</a> with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data. Deep neural networks can automatically discover representations needed for future detection</li>
	<li>Use cases: image, speech recognition, NLP, autonomous vehicles</li>
	<li>Involves using large datasets to adjust the weights and biases of a neural network through multiple iterations</li>
</ul>


<h3>Generative AI (GenAI)</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">GenAI</a>: generating new content similar to the data they were trained on. They rely on the Transformer Architecture</li>
	<li>Unlabeled Data > Foundation Model > used for general tasks (chatbot, text generation, etc)</li>
	<li>Large Language Models (LLM): Type of AI designed to generate coherent human-like text (GPT-4)</li>
	<li>Foundation Models: trained on a wide variety of input data (GPT-4o)</li>
	<li>Generative Language Models: interact with the LLM by a prompt. The model generate new content. Non-deterministic.</li>
	<li>Example of Models: GPT for text generation and DALL-E for image creation</li>
</ul>
