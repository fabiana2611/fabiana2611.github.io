	<li><em>Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy.</em> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence">[1]</a></li>
	<li>Techniques:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/computer-vision/">Computer Vision:</a> based on the computer video analysis of images in real time. Whereas computer vision involves <u>interpreting and understanding</u> the content of images to make decisions, image processing focuses on enhancing and manipulating images for visual quality. CNNs are used for single image analysis and RNNs are used for video analysis. ResNet is a deep neural network architecture used mainly in computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning">Deep Learning:</a> uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. CNNs are a type of deep learning model</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Machine Learning (ML)</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/">Machine Learning</a> creates models from training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on data.</li>
	<li>The performance is improved when they are exposed to more data</li>
	<li>Machine Learning models can be deterministic (e.g Decision Trees) or probabilistic (e.g Bayesian Networks) or a mix of both (e.g neural networks and random forests) </li>
	<li>Use cases: spam detection, recommendation systems, predictive analytics</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Deep Learning (DL)</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Subset of ML</li>
	<li>It utilizes artificial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">neural networks</a> with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data. Deep neural networks can automatically discover representations needed for future detection</li>
	<li>Use cases: image, speech recognition, NLP, autonomous vehicles</li>
	<li>Involves using large datasets to adjust the weights and biases of a neural network through multiple iterations</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Generative AI (GenAI)</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">GenAI</a>: generating new content similar to the data they were trained on. They rely on the Transformer Architecture</li>
	<li>Unlabeled Data > Foundation Model > used for general tasks (chatbot, text generation, etc)</li>
	<li>Large Language Models (LLM): Type of AI designed to generate coherent human-like text (GPT-4)</li>
	<li>Foundation Models: trained on a wide variety of input data (GPT-4o)</li>
	<li>Generative Language Models: interact with the LLM by a prompt. The model generate new content. Non-deterministic.</li>

It can be Classification, Regression (e.g: Linear regression - predicting a price; spam detection), Neural Network</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised Learning</a> (groups without label): clustering, Association rule learning, Probability density, Anomaly detection, dymnesionality regression, dymnesionality reduction</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/semi-supervised-learning">Semi-supervised</a> (mix) (e.g speech recognition, Document classification, Fraud Detection, Sentiment analysis)</li>

	<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/reinforcement-learning/">Reinforcement Learning</a> (try fit - learn by success and failure): focuses on an agent learning optimal actions through interactions with the environment and feedback (robotics, game playing, and industrial automation)</li>
</ul>

<ul><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/model-explainability-aws-ai-ml/interpretability-versus-explainability.html">Algorithms:</a>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p><b>Pipeline:</b> Fetch -> Clean -> Prepare -> Train and tune model -> Evaluate model -> Deploy to prod </p>

<ul><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/create-train-test-and-validation-splits-on-your-data-for-machine-learning-with-amazon-sagemaker-data-wrangler/">Data:</a>
	<li>The training set is used to train the model</li>
	<li>The validation set (optional) is used for periodically measure model performance as training is happening and also tune any hyperparameters of the model, selecting the best model during the training process</li>
	<li>The test set is used for evaluating the final performance of the model on unseen data (how well the model generalizes)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/">Process: </a> Collect data > [Pre-process data + Data Preparation] (repeat ETL operation until data is prepared) -> [Apply ML Algorithm to ETL Data + Potential Models] (repeat to find the best model) > Deploy selected model </p>

<p><b>Data Collection:</b> Gathering the necessary data from various sources (Fetch)</p>

<ul><b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Cleaning and preparing the data for training
	<li>Handle missing values(filling or removing), Inconsistent data (standardize data types, units of measurement), Duplicate (removing or merging) </li>

		<ul>
			<li>selecting, modifying, or creating features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models</li>
			<li>for structured data often involves tasks such as normalization and handling missing values, while for unstructured data, it involves tasks such as tokenization and vectorization</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Techniques: 
		<ul>
			<li>Feature selection: selecting a subset of the most relevant features from the original dataset </li>
			<li>Feature Extraction: transforming the data into a new feature space </li>
			<li>Dimensionality Reduction;</li>
			<li>Category Enconding;</li>
			<li>Data augmentation: artificially increase the size and variability of the training dataset by creating modified versions of the existing data</li>
		</ul>
	</li>	
	<li><b>Generating Data</b>:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/exploratory-data-analysis-feature-engineering-and-operationalizing-your-data-flow-into-your-ml-pipeline-with-amazon-sagemaker-data-wrangler/">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</a>:

	<li>Recall (Sensitivity): Measures the ability of the classifier to identify all positive instances, calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.</li>
	<li>F1-Score: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns.</li>
</ul>


<ul><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/a-comprehensive-overview-of-regression-evaluation-metrics/">Metrics of Regression Models:</a>
	<li>Mean Absolute Error (MAE): measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions (accuracy of a continuous variable's predictions)</li>
	<li>Mean Square Error (MSE)</li>
	<li>Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): calculating the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.</li>
	<li>Rˆ2 (R Squared)</li>
