<a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/foundation-models">Foundation Models</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Large, general-purpose pre-trained models</li>
	<li>They can be adapted for various tasks</li>
	<li>ChatGPT: trained model</li>
	<li>A multimodal model can accept a mix of input types such as audio/text and create a mix of output types such as video/image</li>
</ul>

Large language models (LLM)<a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models?">[1]</a><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/">[2]</a> 
<ul>
	<li>It is a subset of foundation models that can understand and generate human language</li>
	<li>Focused on language-based tasks (summarization, text generation, classification, open-ended conversation, and information extraction)</li>
	<li>They are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data</li>
	<li>It uses DL to analyze and predict word sequences</li>
	<li>Examples: OpenAI's generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models</li>
	<li>Services for LLM: AWS Bedrock and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/">Amazon SageMaker JumpStart</a></li>
</ul>

Data: 
<ul>
 	<li>Training Data: Inputs variables (e.g image) and Target Variables (e.g label that identify the image)</li>
 	<li>Type of data: Structured data (Tabular) and Unstructured data (text, images, audio)</li>
</ul>

Goals of training:
<ul>
	<li>Training data --> Model --> Trained Model</li>

Model Fit: How accurate do predictions (Probability) <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html">[1]</a><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html">[2]</a><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/overfitting/">[3]</a>
<ul>
	<li><b>Underfitting</b> occurs when a model cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training data and new data. When underfit models experience high bias they give inaccurate results.</li>
	<li><b>Overfitting</b> happens when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, leading to excellent performance on the training data but poor generalization to new, unseen data. When overfit models experience high variance they give accurate results. Prevention: cross-validation, regularization (L1 and L2 - penalization), and pruning to simplify the model and improve its generalization. A model with unnecessarily high complexity (e.g too many parameters) is a common indicator of overfitting</li>
	<li>It's necessary a balance</li>
</ul>

[Tokens](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them): 
- building blocks of language models. 
- Tokens are the individual units that generative AI modes work with
- It's a process of converting raw text into a sequence of tokens
- Ex:  Words, part of words
- Context windows: number of tokens an LLM can take in when generating text

Chancking: 
- break larger inputs into smaller, manageable sections
- helps manage larger datasets by breaking them down into smaller pieces

How AI models represent and understand data:
<ul>
	<li><a href=" https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/embeddings-in-machine-learning/">Embeddings:</a> Embedding models are algorithms trained to encapsulate information into dense representations in a multi-dimensional space. Ex: BERT, Word2Vec (use static embeddings)</li> 
	<li>Vectors: Numerical arrays of embeddings that indicate where a value or object is located</li>
	<li>Tokens + Embeddings: Input Text > Tokens ("Create", "an", "image") > Each token is converted into a vector embeddings ("0.56","0.3","0.87") > Model Processing</li>
</ul>

Different GenAI Models:
<ul>
	<li>Foundation models
		<ul>
			<li>large scale pre-trained models designeds to be adaptable across a wide range of tasks</li>
			<li>provide a robust starting point</li>
			<li>Expensive</li>
			<li>Examples: Titan (Amazon), Cloude (Anthropic), Stable Diffusion (Stability AI), Llama (Meta)</li>
			<li>These models undergo a multi-stage process:
				<ul>
					<li>Pre-trained on massive datasets to learn patterns, structures and relatioships between the data</li>
					<li>Fine tunned for specific tasks</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Multimodal models <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/training-machine-learning-models-on-multimodal-health-data-with-amazon-sagemaker/">[1]</a><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/multimodal-data-analysis-with-aws-health-and-machine-learning-services/">[2]</a>
		<ul>
			<li>extension of foundation models</li>
			<li>can process and understand multiple types of input data and create a mix of output types</li>
			<li>typically used for generating new content rather than interpreting and responding to queries</li>
			<li>handle and integrate multi types of data</li>
			<li>Chatbot (understand voice command and respond visually)</li>
			<li>Dall-E, Titan</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Diffusion models
		<ul>
			<li>generate high quality images</li>
			<li>Take a noise image and gradually refine it</li>
			<li>Steps:
				<ul>
					<li>Forward diffusion: propagating information from an initial source to other nodes or layers in the model, allowing for the flow of data in a specific direction.</li>
					<li>Backward diffusion (reverse process): propagating information from the output or final layer back to the input or initial source, allowing for the flow of data in the opposite direction to refine and adjust the model</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>work by corrupting data with noise through a forward diffusion process and then learning to reverse this process to denoise the data.</li>
			<li>use neural networks to predict and remove the noise step by step, ultimately generating new, structured data from random noise.</li>
			<li>Example: DALL-E, Adobe Firefly, Stable Diffusion (produces unique photorealistic images from text and image prompts)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Transformer-based LLMs
		<ul>
			<li>LLMs that are transformer-based has a transformer architechture that basically transforms the input, words or tokens, to achieve a desired output, words, images or videos</li>
			<li>It uses self-attention: it allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding a particular word, identifing relationships and dependencies between words.</li>
			<li>The transformer-based generative model employs multiple encoder layers called attention heads to capture different types of relationships between words.</li>
			<li>The underlying transformer is a set of neural networks that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities.</li>
			<li>This models play a key role in generative AI by enabling systems to process and generating human-Like text</li>
			<li>Examples:
				<ul>
					<li>GPT-4</li>
					<li>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): free foundation modal.  It is specifically designed to capture the contextual meaning of words by looking at both the words that come before and after them (bidirectional context). BERT creates dynamic word embeddings that change depending on the surrounding text, allowing it to understand the different meanings of the same word in various contexts.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>	
</ul>

Foundation Model Lifecycle <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/best-practices-to-build-generative-ai-applications-on-aws/">[Best Practices]</a>
<ul>
 	<li>Data Selection: choose relevant and high quality data to train the model</li>
	<li>Model Selection: chosen base on requirements</li>
	<li>Pre-training: Epoch (complete iteration through a training dataset during model training); The number of epoch is a hyperparameter (underfitting, overfitting). Increasing the number of epochs allows the model to learn from the training data for a longer period. Multiple epochs are run until the accuracy of the model reaches an acceptable level, or when the error rate drops below an acceptable level.</li>
	<li>Fine-tuning: where pretreined model is customized with task-specific data. Involves training an LLM on a smaller, specialized, labeled dataset </li>
	<li>Evaluation: test the accuracy</li>
	<li>Deployment: put the model in production</li>
	<li>Feedback: get real word return</li>
</ul>

Advantages:
- Adaptability: different types of tasks
- Responsiveness: produce real-time response
- Simplicity: frameworks and platforms for this

Disadvantages:
- Hallucinations: the output seems correct but it's not (reasons: overfitting, bias, high model complexity )
- Lack of interpretability: complexity

- Bias

Model Selection Factors:
- Model types: Foundation models, transformer-based LLMs, diffusion model, multimodal models
- Performance and Capabilities Requirements: latency, response time, throughput
- Compliance: regulations
- Constraints: hardware requirement, scalability, model size

Metrics:
- Efficiency: how well perform task with minimal resources. How cost-effectively and quickly the AI model can be deployed, focusing on resource utilization and time to market. (Latency,Throughput, Resource Utilization). Often evaluated using benchmark datasets
- Accuracy (percentage of correct prediction). Often evaluated using benchmark datasets
- Conversion rate: percentage of users who take a desired action (purchases, sign-ups, or task completion	). Effectiveness of driving desired outcomes. 
- Revenue (average amount of money)
- Customer lifetime value
- Cross-domain performance: measure a model's ability to perform well across various tasks or domain
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): used to measure how much revenue is generated per user over a given period. ARPU is calculated by dividing the total revenue generated by the total number of users, providing insights into the average revenue generated by each user.
- Scalability: measure how well a model can handle an increasing amount of data or workload. commonly evaluated using benchmark datasets

<h2 id="prompt">Prompt Engineering</h2>

<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/prompt-engineering/">Concepts</a>
<ul>
	<li>Give instruction to AI</li>
	<li>Clear, spefific, and contextually relevant</li>
	<li>Techniques: 
		<ul>
			<li>Instructions – a task for the model to do (description, how the model should perform)</li>
			<li>Context – external information to guide the model</li>
			<li>Input data – the input for which you want a response</li>
			<li>Output Indicator – the output type or format</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>negative prompts, model latent space (model use to connect concepts)</li>
</ul>

Tecniques:
- zero-shot prompting
- few-shot prompt
- chain-of-thought prompting:  breaks down a complex question into smaller
- prompt tempates

Benefits:
- clear, consise prompts lead to high-quality outputs
- experimentation uncovers new insights and discoveries
- guardrails ensure safe and relevant answers
- multiple comment improve depth and structure

Risks and limitations <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/llm-prompt-engineering-best-practices/common-attacks.html">[1]</a>
<ul>
	<li>exposure: risk of <u>exposing sensitive or confidential information</u> to a model during training or inference</li>
	<li>poisoning: intentional introduction of malicious or biased data <u>into the training dataset</u> of a model which leads to the model producing biased, offensive, or harmful outputs (intentionally or unintentionally)</li>
	<li>hijacking: involves <u>manipulating an AI system</u> to serve malicious purposes or to misbehave in unintended ways.</li>
	<li>jailbreaking: <u>bypassing</u> the built-in restrictions and safety measures of AI systems to unlock restricted functionalities or generate prohibited content.</li>
	<li>Prompt Injection: <u>influencing the outputs</u> by embedding specific instructions within the prompts themselves</li>
	<li>Prompt Leaking:  <u>unintentional disclosure or leakage</u> of the prompts or inputs used within a model. It can expose protected data or other data used by the model, such as how the model works.</li>
</ul>

Prevention:
- Creating a prompt template that specifically guides the LLM to detect and respond appropriately to potential attack patterns is an effective way to mitigate prompt engineering attacks. [(Best Practices)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/llm-prompt-engineering-best-practices/best-practices.html)
- Validating (input formats, lengths, and types) and sanitizing (Cleans the input by removing or encoding harmful elements) user input before processing it in the model is a primary method for mitigating the risk of prompt injection attacks in generative AI models. [(injection)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-injection.html)

<h2 id="responsible">Responsible AI</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/responsible-ai">Responsible AI</a> is a set of principles that help guide the design, development, deployment and use of AI—building trust in AI solutions that have the potential to empower organizations and their stakeholders. It ensures that the ML algorithms are ethical, transparent, and trustworthy.</p>

Dimensions:
- Fairness and Bias Mitigation: Inclusivity; Diversity in data; Criteria for Curating Data (Balanced Representation, Multiple high-quality sources, Ethical Data Labeling)
- Explainability [(1)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/model-explainability-aws-ai-ml/interpretability-versus-explainability.html): focuses on providing understandable reasons for the model's predictions and behaviors to stakeholders. It goes a step further by providing insights into why a model made a specific prediction, especially when the model itself is complex and not inherently interpretable
- Interpretability:  understanding the internal mechanisms of a machine learning model. How easily a human can understand the reasoning behind a model's predictions or decisions
- Transperency
- Robustness (adapt) 
- Veracity (reliable and truthful)
- Controllability
- Model selection and Environmental Susteinability
- Safety
- Privacy and Security


Trade-offs:
- Bias vs Variance trade-off: challenge of balancing the error due to the model's complexity (variance) and the error due to incorrect assumptions in the model (bias)
- Controllability vs. Complexity: trade-off between the level of control a user has over the model's behavior and the complexity of the model itself
- Safety vs. Transparency: trade-off between ensuring the model's predictions are safe and ethical while also being transparent and understandable to users
- Interpretability vs. Performance: trade-off between the model's ability to be easily interpreted and understood by humans versus its overall performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. 
- Transparency vs interpretability vs Performance: High transparency = Hight Interpretability = Poor Performance


Poor Model:
- Bias: difference between the predictive and actual values (level of error)
- High bias (underfitting): the model doesn't learn enough from the training set and performs poorly on both the training and test data
- High Variance (overfitting): the model learns the data too well, including the noise. It does well on training set, but poorly on inseen data
- Variance: extent to which the model's predictions change when trained on different data



Types of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/detect-bias-in-ml-models-and-explain-model-behavior-with-amazon-sagemaker-clarify/">Bias</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Measurement Bias: <u>faulty</u> data. it involves inaccuracies in data collection, such as faulty equipment or inconsistent measurement processes. </li>
	<li>Sampling Bias: data is <u>not representative</u> of the population as a whole (train the model does not accurately reflect the diversity of the real-world population)</li>
	<li>Confirmation Bias: try to confirm <u>what you believe</u>. it involves selectively searching for or interpreting information to confirm existing beliefs.</li>
	<li>Observer Bias: collecting or labeling the data has their own <u>subjective</u> opinions of preference. it relates to human errors or subjectivity during data analysis or observation.</li>
</ul>


Risks:
- Hallucination
- prompt misuses
- Intellectual property


Governance:
- Policies, practices, and tools
- Amazon Augmented AI [(A21)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-use-augmented-ai-a2i-human-review-loops.html): human judgement, allowing for reviews and corrections of model predictions
Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) is a service that makes it easy to build the workflows required for human review of ML predictions. Amazon A2I brings human review to all developers, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building human review systems or managing large numbers of human reviewers
- Amazon Badrock Guardrails evaluate the input and output of foundation models
- [Data residency](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/addressing-data-residency-with-aws/) is concerned with the physical location of data storage, whereas data retention defines the policies for how long data should be stored and maintained
