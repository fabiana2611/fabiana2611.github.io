<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.fundamentals-of-devops.com/">Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery"</a> by Yevgeniy Brikman (creator of Gruntwork and author of <a href="https://fabiana2611.github.io/books/terraform-book">Terraform: Up & Running</a>) is a comprehensive and complete guide designed to bridge the gap between writing code and running it in production. The book defines DevOps not just as a job title, but as a cultural shift focused on breaking down silos and automating the entire software delivery lifecycle.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The book is structured around five core pillars: Infrastructure, Architecture, Deployment, Operations, and Culture. Rather than focusing on a single tool, the author provides a high-level roadmap of the entire software delivery lifecycle. Ultimately, Brikman teaches that modern software delivery is about building high-trust environments where automation is the default.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">. It is an essential guide for anyone looking to understand how the world’s most successful tech companies manage complexity at scale while maintaining a fast, repeatable path to production. It is an essential read for both developers and platform engineers.</p>
