I am a Java Developer with over 9 years of experience in Java and over 4 years of experience using Scrum. I did my undergraduate and Master's degrees in Computer Science.

I work in a WEB DEVELOPMENT team using Web Service where I am responsible for implementing user stories, fix bugs, from pages to business rules.

I am very motivated about working in dynamic, fast-paced and continuously-evolving environments, where I might be able to explore, learn and develop new technologies and their applications.

In the current moment, I'm working in Porto, Portugal, where I have great moments. And I post about that in another [blog](https://biaintech.wordpress.com/category/portugal/) to share my experience in this wonderful place.
